The easiest way to make a strong password is by making it long (12+ characters) — consider using a 'passphrase' made up of many words. Alternatively, use a password generator to create a long, strong random password. Have a play with [Security.org's How Secure Is My Password?](https://security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/), to get an idea of how quickly common passwords can be cracked.

Most password managers have browser extensions and mobile apps, so whatever device you are on, your passwords can be auto-filled.

It's easy to get started, download [an authenticator app](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#2-factor-authentication) onto your phone, and then go to your account security settings and follow the steps to enable 2FA.

It is also possible for keyloggers to be planted inside the keyboard housing, so look for any signs that the case has been tampered with, and consider bringing your own keyboard to work.

[SoloKey](https://solokeys.com) and [NitroKey](https://www.nitrokey.com) are examples of such keys. They bring with them several security benefits. Since the browser communicates directly with the device, it cannot be fooled as to which host is requesting authentication because the TLS certificate is checked. [This post](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/71704) is a good explanation of the security of using FIDO U2F tokens.

		"Smart phones have revolutionized so many aspects of life and brought the world to our fingertips. For many of us, smart phones are our primary means of communication, entertainment and access to knowledge. But while they've brought convenience to whole new level, there's some ugly things going on behind the screen.\nGeo-tracking is used to trace our every move, and we have little control over who has this data- your phone is even able to [track your location without GPS](https://gizmodo.com/how-to-track-a-cellphone-without-gps-or-consent-1821125371). Over the years numerous reports that surfaced, outlining ways in which your phone's [mic can eavesdrop](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/smartphone-apps-listening-privacy-alphonso-shazam-advertising-pool-3d-honey-quest-a8139451.html), and the [camera can watch you](https://www.businessinsider.com/hackers-governments-smartphone-iphone-camera-wikileaks-cybersecurity-hack-privacy-webcam-2017-6)- all without your knowledge or consent. And then there's the malicious apps, lack of security patches and potential/ likely backdoors.\nUsing a smart phone generates a lot of data about you- from information you intentionally share, to data silently generated from your actions. It can be scary to see what Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook know about us- sometimes they know more than our closest family. It's hard to comprehend what your data will reveal, especially in conjunction with other data.\nThis data is used for [far more than just advertising](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-sides-of-data-tracking/) - more often it's used to rate people for finance, insurance and employment. Targeted ads can even be used for fine-grained surveillance (see [ADINT](https://adint.cs.washington.edu))\nMore of us are concerned about how [governments use collect and use our smart phone data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/373916/global-opinion-online-monitoring-government/), and rightly so, federal agencies often [request our data from Google](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273501/global-data-requests-from-google-by-federal-agencies-and-governments/), [Facebook](https://www.statista.com/statistics/287845/global-data-requests-from-facebook-by-federal-agencies-and-governments/), Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and other tech companies. Sometimes requests are made in bulk, returning detailed information on everybody within a certain geo-fence, [often for innocent people](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/13/us/google-location-tracking-police.html).

Since you have limited control on what is being collected, how it's stored, and what it will be used for, this makes it hard to recommend any consumer smart-home products to anyone who cares about privacy and security.\nSecurity vs Privacy: There are many smart devices on the market that claim to increase the security of your home while being easy and convenient to use (Such as Smart Burglar Alarms, Internet Security Cameras, Smart Locks and Remote access Doorbells to name a few). These devices may appear to make security easier, but there is a trade-off in terms of privacy: as they collect large amounts of personal data, and leave you without control over how this is stored or used. The security of these devices is also questionable, since many of them can be (and are being) hacked, allowing an intruder to bypass detection with minimum effort.\nThe most privacy-respecting option, would be to not use \"smart\" internet-connected devices in your home, and not to rely on a security device that requires an internet connection.
